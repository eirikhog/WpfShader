# WpfShader

Sometimes, working with UI programming can be a bit tiresome and boring.
I knew WPF used DirectX for rendering, so I wanted to see if it was possible to write a custom shader and apply it to my otherwise mundane business software.

Turns out that it was really easy to do!
This repository contains the source code for a couple of shaders, and a demo application which uses them.
